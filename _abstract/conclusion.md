## Conclusion
These results suggest that the delta-band neural response to words is modulated by its involvement in linguistic structures â€“ information that is added by the brain to the sensory signal. That this difference persists when context-driven lexical features like entropy and surprisal are added, implies that language comprehension cannot rely solely on sequential prediction: the brain takes structural information into account when processing words. The findings are in line with analysis-by-synthesis accounts of language comprehension that capitalize on the symbolic and compositional nature of language (Martin, 2016; 2020).
